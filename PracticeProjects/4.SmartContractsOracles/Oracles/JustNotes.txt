Types of attacks

- Sybil: one entity that pretends to be many entities 
- Cartel: a group that colludes to create outcomes that favor them
- Mirroring: influence many oracles to tip the balance and influence the outcome of things
- Free loading: steal the output of another output and pretend its their without staking
- Privacy: takes advantage of confidential data it should not have in order to tip the scales

Preventing these

- Block the means of communication between oracles
- Block ability to identify oracles 
- block ability to see answers submitted by other oracles
